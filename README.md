A menu-based program that manages employee payroll records. It stores the data in arrays and calculates each employee's gross salary, tax and net salary automatically.

## Features
- Sort all records by Employee ID or Gross Salary (ascending or descending)
- Add a new employee record (Employee ID must be unique)
- Delete an employee record by Employee ID
- Show employees with net salary greater than or equal to X, or less than X
- Update the hours worked or hourly rate of an employee (salary is recalculated)
- Checks the user's input, so wrong input does not crash the program

## How salary is calculated
- Gross salary = hours worked x hourly rate
- Tax = 10% of gross salary
- Net salary = gross salary - tax
